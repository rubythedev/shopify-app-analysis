# Shopify App Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the Shopify App Store to uncover key factors that contribute to the success of various apps. By utilizing Power BI, we generate visualizations that highlight app statistics, review dynamics, and developer responsiveness.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `shopify.xlsx`, which includes the following four tables:
- **apps**: Contains details about apps on the Shopify apps marketplace.
- **apps_categories**: Joins apps with their respective categories.
- **categories**: Lists all available app categories.
- **reviews**: Provides user opinions about the apps, including ratings, comments, and developer responses.

## Introduction
This analysis aims to identify the characteristics of successful Shopify apps by examining app statistics, user reviews, and developer engagement. Understanding these factors can help stakeholders make informed decisions when choosing or developing apps.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze the landscape of apps on Shopify.
- Examine the correlation between reviews and ratings.
- Evaluate the impact of developer responses on user ratings.
- Identify trends in app reviews over time.

## Methodology
1. **App Landscape Analysis**:
   - Created a KPI card to display the unique number of apps.
   - Generated a line chart showing the sum of review counts over time.
   - Produced a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between review counts and average ratings.

2. **Reviews Analysis**:
   - Developed a helpful reviews metric using a DAX expression.
   - Created a scatterplot to compare average ratings based on whether developers responded to reviews.

3. **App Reviews Analysis**:
   - Established a relationship between the Reviews and Apps tables.
   - Generated bar charts to analyze ratings by developer and to assess developer responsiveness.
